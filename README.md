# HELIOS Project Template
    I DID NOT MAKE THIS TEMPLATE PROJECT I JUST PUT IT HERE ON GITHUB
 This is a simple HELIOS unreal project template project, it contains:
 - HELIOS SDK
 - A mirror
 - A car
 - UI (template window with button)
 - Simple Wall
 - Test Dummy model
 - Projector model
 - projector screen
 - UI (Video Player with UI controls)
 - Prop Gun
 - Desk with openable doors
+ I found that videos don't load that well in HELIOS with just youtube links or youtube music links, so in this project theres a simple python script (in the YTLinkConv folder) to utilize this repo from github: <https://github.com/ShayBox/VRC-YT> (I tried this and the videos are prefect, no lag and the quality isn't affected at all)

(Unreal version used with this project: 4.26.2)
